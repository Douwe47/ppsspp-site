# PPSSPP Gold - the what and why

## Why active no Buy PSSPP Gold?

PPSSPP Gold has everything that the free version also has:

* Fast emulation and more platforms than any other PSP emulator
* Save states
* Enhanced high-resolution graphics with upscaled textures
* Turbo button for those slow-to-play RPGs

PPSSPP Gold also:

* Makes you feel good.
* Has a fancy golden icon you can show off to your friends.
* Most importantly, lets me (Henrik) spend more time working on the emulator.

## What platforms is PPSSPP Gold available for?

PPSSPP Gold is currently available for Android and Windows.

More platforms are planned to be added in the future, but as these are by far the most popular two, they got done first.

Whether you own PPSSPP Gold for one of those platforms or not, feel free to use the free versions on any platforms you have, as much as you want.

## Why do I need to enter my phone number when making a purchase?

A: The payment provider uses the phone number in its algorithms to prevent credit card fraud. It is not actually used - you will not get calls from anyone.
